## Demo

A live demo of the finished project can be found [here](https://mabelsueh.github.io/trent-assignment-1/).

## **Motivation:**
This project requires us to create a website with interactive elements implemented using JavaScript, while also demonstrating 
understanding of the Five Planes of UI/UX. I have chosen to create an single page website with the purpose of advertising bespoke leather crafting services with a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing site that can be navigated intuitively. 

# 
## **Goals & User stories:**

### Owner's Goal:  To advertise my service online with ease and receive enquiries.

### Owner's User Stories:
-  As an owner, I want my customers to have a smooth browsing experience. 
-  As an owner, I want to update my promotions easily so they can be changed seasonally. 
-  As an owner, I want to display customer reviews so that I seem trustable. 

### User's Goal: To view and the website and navigate with ease. 

### User's User Stories:

- As a site visitor, I want the website to be easy to navigate so I can shop easily. 
- As a site visitor, I want to read reviews about the business so I can engage in the service with a peace of mind. 
- As a site visitor, I want to enquire before committing to any consultation or service so I don't waste time and money.

## **Choices behind surface of the project:** 
I chose the background images that gave off a luxurious leather workshop 
vibe and based off the rest of the colour scheme by selecting colors similar to the pictures via a dropper tool.
I chose the Montserrat font in sans-serif as I stumbled upon it while looking through fonts that resembled luxurious brand logos.
In all, the pictures, colours and font choice are all to give off a professional and luxurious feeling so that visitors will have faith in the brand's cratsmanship.
