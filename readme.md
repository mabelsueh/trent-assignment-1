# **TGC DSD Assignment 1**

## **Motivation:**
This project requires us to create a website with interactive elements implemented using JavaScript, while also demonstrating 
understanding of the Five Planes of UI/UX. I have chosen to create an e-commerce site with the purpose of selling quality leathercraft tools and kits 
with a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing site that can be navigated intuitively.
