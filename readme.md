You have to write a report to accompany your assignment submission. Make sure that it is named as readme.md and use the appropriate markup syntax to write it. The report should:

2. List down the scope of the project (features and requirements, non-technical requirements, content requirements) 



3. Provide the structure of the project (site map) 



4. Provide the skeleton of the project (mock-ups) 


5. Explain the choices behind the surface of the project (why a particular font, colour scheme, mood of background images etc.)
